**Job Description:**
We are seeking a highly skilled and innovative **Backend Developer (AI)** with deep expertise in **Python** and modern AI frameworks to join our team. You will be responsible for building and optimizing AI-powered backend systems, with a focus on **FastAPI**, **Groq API**, and AI integration tools like **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex**. The ideal candidate will have experience in working with vector databases and implementing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines for cutting-edge AI applications.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Develop and maintain high-performance backend APIs using **FastAPI** and other Python-based frameworks.
- Integrate AI models and SDKs such as **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, and **PyTorch** into backend systems to power AI-driven features.
- Work with **Groq API** to optimize AI model deployment, ensuring efficient and scalable AI services.
- Design and implement **RAG pipelines**, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant information and integration with generative AI models.
- Manage, optimize, and scale AI systems using **vector databases** such as **Pinecone**, **Chroma**, or other similar databases to support fast and accurate search and retrieval.
- Collaborate with front-end developers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers to design robust AI-backed solutions.
- Implement scalable and maintainable backend architectures to support dynamic AI services.
- Optimize models for inference and ensure low-latency responses from the API endpoints.
- Stay up to date with the latest AI/ML technologies and apply them to enhance our backend systems.
- Monitor, debug, and resolve issues related to AI model performance, backend systems, and database interactions.

**Qualifications:**
- Extensive experience in **Python** with hands-on expertise in **FastAPI** and **PyTorch** for building and deploying backend services.
- Proficiency with **AI integration tools** such as **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex** for enhancing backend capabilities with AI-driven models.
- Knowledge and experience with **Groq API** or other AI hardware/software optimization tools.
- Strong experience working with **vector databases** like **Pinecone**, **Chroma**, or similar, optimizing data retrieval processes.
- Proven experience implementing **RAG pipelines** to improve retrieval processes in generative AI applications.
- Solid understanding of **APIs**, backend best practices, and scalable infrastructure design.
- Familiarity with cloud-based AI deployment and services (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.).
- Strong problem-solving skills and an ability to deliver results in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.
- Good communication and collaboration skills, capable of working cross-functionally with AI researchers, data engineers, and front-end developers.
- Bonus: Experience with MLOps pipelines and model serving frameworks.

If you’re excited about the intersection of backend development and artificial intelligence, and you have experience with **RAG pipelines** and **vector databases**, we’d love to hear from you!
